      content1:
        "Sociology focuses on societal aspects such as social interaction, social behavior, social change, and the social correlation and causations of human behavior. This field of study explores and evaluates all the characteristics which makes a society whole. For example, primary institution, secondary institutions, beliefs, values, and norms.",
      content2:
        "A degree in this branch of study will provide you with insights that help understand the choices an individual makes, and how those choices shape their lives along with the society theyâ€™re living in. Sociology graduates also gain the ability to critically think about social topics and problems that occur in our society. Sociology enriches student lives while also preparing them for employment in a world that is becoming increasingly diverse.",
      content3:
        "A program in sociology will teach you skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, interpersonal communication, and fieldwork skills, which will not only benefit you academically, but wherever you may decide to go.",

      content1:
        "Have you ever wondered why a criminal commits crime? Why teenagers resort to deviant behavior? Or how the building blocks of a culture are set in place? If yes, then this is the field of study youâ€™ve been in search of.",
      content2:"Before diving into Sociology, you need to make sure you can express your thoughts, relate everyday experiences to what youâ€™re studying, and analyse data effectively. This will enable you to formulate and test hypotheses. Your job would demand you to think critically, improvise, and find quick but effective solutions. If you think you have these character traits, then this field of study is well suited to you.",

      title: "Sociology study options and costs",
      content1:
        "The cost of a bachelorâ€™s of Sociology is on average $27,488 for international students. A masterâ€™s in this degree is about 1-2 years in duration. If youâ€™re planning on doing masterâ€™s full-time, it would cost you around $21,000 per year and if you decide to do it half-time, that will cost around $11,000 per year. Since masters is an advanced degree as compared to bachelors, this will incorporate subjects such as politics of environment, qualitative and quantitative data analysis, social research, social change leading to political order, sociology of violence, power structures, cultural norms, and sociology of religion.",
      content2:"After having a bachelors and masterâ€™s degree, if your passion for Sociology perseveres, put your best foot forward to enroll yourself in a PhD programme. A PhD in Sociology would mean spending another three years of your life, six if youâ€™re doing it half time, studying. A PhD in Sociology costs around $20,500 per year. This is perhaps the most challenging programme due to the extensive fieldwork you are required to do, on any topic of your choice.",

        "After all the hassle one might go through, the future outlooks of this course are bright.
