        "Earth sciences contribute greatly towards knowledge regarding how society can cope with the changing environment in different ways. The study of the atmosphere, water flowing on or beneath continental surfaces, and oceans and seas are all components of earth sciences. Knowledge regarding earth sciences helps learn about the planet's structure, processes, and features. The stratigraphy, structure of the earth and its knowledge not only enlightens us regarding the chemical composition of the earthâ€™s structure but also enables us to improve the quality of life for the communities we operate in.",

      content:
        "Earth Sciences degrees are usually offered as a Bachelor of Science (BSc in Earth Sciences) as well as Bachelors of Arts (BA). They are typically 4-year programs. After completing the undergraduate program, students can opt for a masters in earth sciences, which is typically a 2-year program. The average cost of pursuing an earth science degree is AUD 35,000per year in the US. ",

      content3:
        "After having completed you masterâ€™s you have the opportunity to study Public Health at the doctoral level. A PhD programme usually takes 3 to 5 years of full-time study to complete. Original research and a dissertation on a sub-topic of Public Health is required to earn your doctoral degree.",

      content:
        "As the worldâ€™s natural resources continue declining at alarming rates, the need for environmental conservation has gained importance more than ever before. Issues such as atmospheric warming, melting glaciers and rising sea levels pose significant challenges which means earth science professionals will be in demand in the coming years. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, a 7% growth in employment opportunities for geoscientists is projected over the next decade. ",
