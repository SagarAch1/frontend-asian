        "Architecture as a field is concerned with the planning and design of structures such as buildings, homes, bridges, and even entire cities. Architects play a central role in the construction and design of any structure and must have a sound understanding of the various facets of construction. It is the responsibility of the architect to design structure creatively while keeping both resource and safety concerns in mind.",

      content:
        "Architects possess the skill-set to analyse, plan in detail, and collaborate with a diverse range of people when working on any project. A professional in this field also needs to have a creative approach towards real-world problems, as itâ€™s important to adapt and work around problems as they might happen during the construction process. An architect also needs to visualise and detail on the map any building, home, or bridge that needs to be constructed. If you are adept at visualisation and are a scrupulous planner then the field of architecture is the right fit for you.",

For a bachelorâ€™s degree, candidates should keep in mind that the general duration of a bachelorâ€™s degree in architecture is 5 years, rather than 4 years like in many other bachelor programs. The general duration of a masterâ€™s program in architecture is 2-3 years.",
      content2:"In the US, the average cost varies from $30,000 to $60,000 annually for a bachelorâ€™s degree. However, some top-ranking universities such as Cornell, UC Berkley, Harvard and UCLA can cost even more.â€¯ In Australia and the UK, the average cost of a bachelorâ€™s degree in architecture is around $40,000-50,000 annually.",

An architect prepares the blueprint which is to be followed by the construction team to successfully construct the building. Furthermore, the architect creates feasibility reports, manages the budget and determines a timeline to be adhered to by the construction crew.",

Many companies hire professional interior designers to create a visual look for their interior that represents the companyâ€™s core values and boosts productivity. Interior designers assess the space available, determine optimal furniture placement, estimate cost and execute their vision for an aesthetically pleasing and functional interior.",
