        "Forensic science is a field that majorly applies to both civil law and criminal law, tilting towards the latter. It is used to figure out how a crime scene has gone about, nitpicking every single detail, and gathering evidence from it. Cases such as sexual abuse and murder depend critically on forensic scientists to piece together all elements for the investigators to bring about justice. On the civil law side, forensic scientists are helpful in determining whether a person charged with a civil offense such as willingly polluting the air or a water source is guilty of the crime or not. The major difference between the traditional sciences and forensic science is that the practitioners of the latter apply it in legal matters. The following are the major fields in forensics:",

        "If you are looking for a career in forensic sciences, you need to ask yourself if you have an aptitude for this field. The things you need to be good at are data collection, analysis of data and evidence, a grip on mathematics and statistics, along with natural sciences, and mainly a problem-solving mind. However, this natural ability in all is not a must, aside from a problem-solving, analytical mind, almost all else can be learned along the way. The main focus and success factor is the motivation for choosing this field. If solving complex issues, finding a needle in the haystack, connecting the dots, and extracting information from data where others fail to do so is your thing, this field can be very well suited for your abilities. In short, thinking, solving, and writing are your friends.",

Researching these things will help you make the best decision of where you want to go and how you want to go about it if you decide to pursue a career in this field.",
      content2:"The average tuition fee per year in a forensic science program is between $10,000-$20,000 in the U.S. While not mandatory, a high GPA in this is usually required to enroll in a forensic science program. However, if someone already has a bachelor‚Äôs degree or doesn‚Äôt want to enroll in a 4-year program, they can also opt to become a Forensic Science Technician. In the U.S., the cost to become a Forensic Science Technician would be between $8000-$15,000.",

The demand for forensic scientists is predicted to increase by over 14% in the United States alone. With growing populations and a move towards the digital realm in the 21st century, the future of forensics is expanding from helping in investigations of homicides, data leaks, financial misappropriations, and cybersecurity among others. The need in highly populated metropolitans of the U.S., India, and China are more and more in need of skilled forensic scientists due to high physical and digital crime rates. The expected demand for forensic experts has been predicted to grow for the decade (the 2020s)",
