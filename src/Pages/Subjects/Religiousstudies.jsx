        "Religious Studies is the in-depth study of what traditions, rituals, and beliefs are attributed to what religion, and how religion has shaped societies. Religion is a major chunk of the lives of people and plays an important social and cultural role. Pursuing Religious Studies will not only help you better understand the influence of religion on social and political interactions but also foster an analytical perspective to view the world.",
      content2:
        "This degree will embed skills, such as critical thinking, logical reasoning, ability to decipher information, and presentation skills, in you. Religious Studies degrees are known for their rigour and vast amounts of information that must be committed to memory. Furthermore, through this degree you will develop an intuition for cultural, ethical, political, and philosophical problems of religions.",

      title: "Is Religious Studies right for me?",
      content1:
        "If you often zone out and wonder about the origin of the world, the existence of a divine creator, and the purpose of this universe, then this degree is well suited to you",
      content2:
        "For example, if you find yourself wondering why Muslims circumambulate the Holy Kaaba seven times, why Sikhs visit the Golden Temple, and why Christians believe in the Holy Trinity, this degree will not only provide you with the answers that you need but help you develop an appreciation of the role religion plays in the life of people.",
        content3:"To excel in this degree programme you must have a good memory, along with being patient. Reading through large textbooks and spending hours on end in the library are some things you must be mentally prepared to do. This might sound like a handful, but if youâ€™re passionate then this degree will significantly broaden your career horizons.",

        "Religious Study programmes are offered at three levels: A bachelorâ€™s which takes 3-4 years, a masterâ€™s which is 2 years, and a PhD which with a full-time study takes around 3-4 years, whereas part-time could take 6-7 years.",
      content2:
        "There are multiple research and specialisation paths when enrolled in a Religious Studies programme. Some of those fields include but are not limited to anthropology of religion, geography of religion, history of religion, origin of religion, and literary and neurological approaches to Religions.",
        content3:"A bachelorâ€™s degree in Religious Studies will educate you about how religion relates to anthropology, what religious aspects make us human, and discuss human experiences of the past, also known as holism. A bachelorâ€™s degree would cost you around $28,584 per academic year in the US. Masterâ€™s degrees which are more in-depth compared to undergraduate programs, typically cost around $30,000 to $40,000. Lastly, a PhD will prepare you to conduct independent research on religious questions that hold your interest using a variety of qualitative approaches. Average cost of PhD is $38,600 due to the intense fieldwork and research requirements.",
