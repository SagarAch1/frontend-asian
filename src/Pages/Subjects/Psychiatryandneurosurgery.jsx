        "Psychiatry is the medical science that focuses on the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of mental disorders. These disorders consist of various maladaptations related to mood, behaviour, cognition, attention and perception. Psychiatrists treat a wide variety of mental health disorders and may choose to specialise in a specific sub-field. Psychiatrists work in several settings including hospitals, mental health clinics, outpatient centres, non-profit organisations and private practices.",

      content2:"Neurosurgery is the medical speciality concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of injuries and diseases, or disorders, of the brain, spinal cord and spinal column, and peripheral nerves within all parts of the body. Neurosurgeons work at hospitals and surgery centres to provide surgical care to neurological conditions. They are often also involved in research related to brain trauma, neurological disorders and surgical techniques used to treat these disorders.",
      content3:"A collaboration of the above-discussed disciplines is known as Psychosurgery, which is not a well-known type of surgery as it is performed in very rare cases when all other treatment options have failed. Psychosurgery is the treatment of psychiatric disorders through Cerebral Neurosurgery in which a small piece of brain that seems to be causing the symptoms of the psychiatric disorder is destroyed or removed. It is usually used to treat severe depression. Psychosurgery is also known as Neurosurgery for Mental Disorders.",

Neurosurgeons perform detail-oriented procedures requiring vasts amount of experience and dedication. Neurosurgeons must be able to perform multiple tasks at once such as keeping an eye on a patientâ€™s vitals as well as performing the surgery. They must have a sense of teamwork and collaboration as a successful surgery needs a multi-disciplinary team.",
        content2:"Psychiatrists are driven by their thirst for knowledge and curiosity which aids them research and when they face an unusual mental health complexity. They must have empathy and good communication skills to discuss the patientâ€™s case. If you want to experience and learn something new every day, then Psychiatry and Neurosurgery could be the right career choice for you.",

The undergraduate program usually takes 4 years to complete. If you want to study neurosurgery, you need to apply to a medical college for post-graduation study. Studies in medical school span 4 years and cost around $250,222 to $330,180 in the US. After medical school, you could apply for a residency in Neurosurgery or Psychiatry.",
