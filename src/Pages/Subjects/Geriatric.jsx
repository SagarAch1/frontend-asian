        "Ageing and the science behind it will be the primary subject of focus of Geriatric Studies. Geriatrics, often known as Geriatric Medicine, is a medical speciality that focuses on the care of the aged. Its goal is to improve the health of the aged by preventing and treating illnesses and impairments. Nurses, physician assistants, pharmacists, social workers, and a variety of other geriatric health professionals frequently collaborate with geriatricians.",
        content2:"Some common course modules students can expect to study are Anatomy, Psychology, Physiology, Nutrition, Exercise, Pain Management, and the study of age-related diseases such as Dementia, Heart Failure, Frailty, Arthritis, Cataracts, and Osteoporosis.",

      title: "Is Geriatric Studies right for me?",
      content1:
        "Obtaining a bachelor's degree is the first step towards becoming a geriatrician. Students will pursue an undergraduate degree after the completion of their secondary education. The bachelorâ€™s degree is recommended to be in a science field such as Biology, Chemistry, or Psychology. After this you will clear your medical college entrance exam to secure admission into a medical school. A four-year medical school programme is followed by a three-year residency. Following residency, a doctor can either work for a period or apply to a geriatric medicine fellowship programme right away.",
        content2:"Geriatric Studies can lead you to multiple career paths such as becoming a geriatric doctor, public health official that specialises in ageing, researcher, educator, geriatric nurse, or even a pharmacist. If you love studying medicine and are interested in healthcare as a field, a degree in Geriatric Studies could unfold a very fulfilling career for you. If you are an empathetic individual who wants to help others lead a better life, particularly the elderly, then this degree might be the right fit for you!",

        content2:"In most cases, you will also have to apply for a license to practice as a medical professional and this is usually done right before applying for a residency. You can also opt for a career in research or education and can pursue a PhD after medical school. Clinical research in Geriatric Studies will allow you to research the different pathways and the science behind the ageing process. You can also work on drugs used to prevent or treat ageing-related issues.",
