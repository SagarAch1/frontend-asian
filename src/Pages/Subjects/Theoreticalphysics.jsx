        "Theoretical physics employs mathematical models, hypotheses and systems of different abstractions, experiments and simulations to formulate theories that explain natural phenomena. This branch of physics will inculcate advanced mathematical and research skills in you along with developing strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The coursework for theoretical physics includes quantum mechanics, astrophysics, thermodynamics, cosmology and much more. A theoretical physics degree, although requires a lot of study, is a respected profession and can lead you to exciting career opportunities.‚ÄØ",

The duration of a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Theoretical Physics is four years and the average tuition and fees is variable according to the university of your choice. However, the average annual tuition fee is AUD 39,800 in Australia. A bachelor‚Äôs degree will prepare the students‚Äô basic foundation for theoretical and applied physics. Newtonian laws, thermodynamics, calculus and electronics along with the basics of nuclear and quantum physics are common coursework. After this, students can secure jobs such as research assistants and high school physics teachers.",

        "Postgraduate degrees are highly-research oriented and an original thesis must be submitted in order to graduate. Tuition fees can vary depending on multiple factors, like specialisation, length of study, university and city. The duration of a master‚Äôs degree is two years and the average tuition costs between AUD 36,000-60,000.",
