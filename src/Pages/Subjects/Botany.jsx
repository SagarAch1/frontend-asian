        "Botany is the branch of biology that explores plant structure, function, and biochemical processes. It also studies plant classification and interactions with the environment. Botanists contribute to sectors such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology. As environmental concerns rise, botanists are also needed in the public sector to address issues like environmental degradation.",

      title: "Is Botany right for me?",
      content:
        "Botany requires a mix of skills. Beyond an interest in plants and biology, aspiring botanists need strong research, analytical, and communication skills. Field and lab work are common, requiring patience and persistence. Knowledge of computers and teamwork is also important. If these qualities resonate with you, botany could be a fulfilling career.",

      title: "Botany study options and costs",
      content:
        "As the global population grows, the demand for crops and healthy plant life increases, along with the challenges posed by plant diseases. To address these issues, specialists in pest and weed control are essential. Agricultural and food scientists are expected to see a 9% growth in job opportunities from 2020 to 2030, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, with around 4,400 job openings annually.",
