      title: "About First Aid",
      content1:
        "First Aid is the emergency care given immediately after an injury to an injured or sick person. The main goal of First Aid is to minimise the consequences of the injury and prevent further health complications. In some cases, First Aid can be crucial in saving a life. It could include placing an unconscious casualty in the recovery position, incident management, performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), use of automated external defibrillators (AED), stopping the bleeding using pressure and elevation and, keeping a fractured limb still.",
        content2:"First Aid education is mandatory for employees in many workplaces and organisations worldwide. The type of first aid equipment and training required depends on the number of employees, the types of hazards present in the workplace and, the travel distance to a hospital/availability of professional medical assistance.",
        content3:"An education in First Aid allows you to become a certified first aid officer. Their primary responsibility is to provide immediate lifesaving care before the arrival of proper medical care. Some common course modules students can expect to study are Injury Assessment, Wounds and Bleeding, Introduction to Skeletal System, Introduction to Circulatory System, Head and Spinal Injuries, Medical Emergencies, Introduction to Respiratory System, Casualty Safety, and Limb Emergencies.",

      title: "Is First Aid right for me?",
      content:
        "As the initial response to a medical emergency is provided by the first aid officer, he must have good analytical skills and should be able to assess the situation well in order to manage it. Staying calm and providing adequate assurance to the casualty is also a significant part of the role. As the first aid officer deals directly with the casualty, they ought to have good communication and leadership skills. If this sounds like you, then First Aid might be the right choice for you.",

        content3:"If you plan to consider certification to become a first aid trainer in Australia, first and foremost, you will need to have an entry-level teaching qualification.‚ÄØTrainers and assessors will be required to hold a TAE40116 Certificate IV in Training and Assessment, or an ASQA recognised equivalent qualification. It is commonly known as the ‚ÄúTrain the Trainer‚Äù qualification, ‚ÄúCert IV TAE‚Äù, or ‚ÄúCert IV Training‚Äù.",
        content4:"After obtaining teaching qualifications that prove your competence as a trainer, the next step is to match your qualifications with relevant experience. You can hold other vocational qualifications and become an eligible trainer for the following courses: Basic Life Support Training (BLS), CPR, First Aid, Emergency Response in Education Care Setting.",
        content5:"The cost of first aid courses, diplomas and programmes, though relatively affordable compared to other fields, varies from country to country, so it‚Äôs best to check with the relevant institutes you are interested in applying at.",
