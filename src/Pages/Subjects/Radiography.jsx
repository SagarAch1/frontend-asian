        "Radiologists are professionals who have had special training in interpreting images that facilitates the diagnosis and treatment of a patient. A degree in Radiography provides you with the skills and experience to become a registered radiographer. You will learn how to use different medical imaging techniques including X-Ray, Computed Tomography (CT), Ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). During your course, you will have the opportunity to learn and apply these techniques, and you may then decide to specialise in one or more of them when you are qualified.",
      content2:
        "Diagnostic radiographers are very important in the world of healthcare. Doctors need accurate radiography tests to diagnose diseases. Most patients undergo a diagnostic assessment before getting treatment, so youâ€™ll play an essential role in improving their health and wellbeing.",

      content:
        "If you are interested in the human anatomy and technology and want to utilise it for the benefit of humankind then getting a degree in Radiography can be a good choice for you. During the degree, youâ€™ll be taught how to use modern equipment and bring together aspects of Biology, Physics and Technology. Youâ€™ll be able to use your expertise across the medical sciences to perform and analyse tests such as MRIs, x-rays, CT scans and angiographs. Most courses include plenty of clinical placement time, so you'll gain real-world experience working alongside NHS and other clinical professionals. A degree in Radiography can be quite intensive. The material is not extremely difficult to learn - however, there is a huge amount of it to get through. You may spend an average of 17 hours per week attending lectures and seminars on a Radiography degree.",

        "High school students interested in Radiography should take courses that focus on Math and Science. After high school, they can enrol for a Bachelorâ€™s in Radiography. During the program, they will learn to administer X-rays and use other medical imaging equipment to help assess, diagnose, and treat injuries/ diseases. Coursework in the bachelorâ€™s Radiography program will cover patient care, such as proper patient positioning and radiation safety, and pertinent medical subjects such as Pathology, Anatomy, and Physiology. A bachelorâ€™s degree spans four years and costs up to $48,510.",
      content3:
        "A masterâ€™s in Radiography will have hands-on training and coursework. Individuals in this program gain an understanding of the ins and outs of the radiology imaging field, methods used and radiologic procedures. Courses may include Health Physics, Radiobiology, Pathophysiology, and Patient Assessment. This degree programme spans two years and costs around $32,425 in the US.",
