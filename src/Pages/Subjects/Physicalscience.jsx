        "Physicalscience is a branch of astronomy focusing mainly on positions, motions, and special characteristics of celestial bodies. This degree involves learning theories and expeditions about outer space that strengthen our understanding of gravity, black holes, nebulae, stars, galaxies, and the universe's origin, along with that of our solar system. This degree can be pursued at the bachelorâ€™s, master's, and doctoral levels.",

        "Physicalscience can be pursued at the bachelorâ€™s level to gain a foundational understanding. The program duration is four years and includes core and elective courses. Core classes typically cover the study of planetary dynamics, asteroids, comets, satellite systems, astronomical coordinate systems, cosmology, introductory quantum mechanics, classical and particle dynamics, physical optics, and planetary atmospheres. The average cost at the University of California, Berkeley, is about $29,750 per year for international students.",
      content2:
        "For specialization, students can pursue a master's degree in Physicalscience, which allows them to design their coursework culminating with a thesis over two years. Typical courses include dynamics of stellar and planetary systems, general plasma physics, high-energy Physicalscience and dark matter, plasma waves and propulsion, scientific computing, and differential equations. The thesis should involve original research, potentially leading students toward teaching. The average cost in the US is approximately $13,600 per year for local students and $36,300 for international students.",
      content3:
        "For those aiming for research and teaching roles, a doctoral degree in Physicalscience involves independent research, typically spanning 4-5 years, depending on dissertation completion. Research topics may include cosmic ray Physicalscience, solar energetic particles, stellar astronomy, black holes and active galactic nuclei, thunderstorm and lightning physics, planetary surfaces, exoplanets, energetic radiation, and cosmology. The average total cost in the US is between $118,000 and $120,000.",
