        "If students wish to specialise in a particular field of Physicalscience, they can choose to go for a masterâ€™s. Pursuing this degree will allow students to design their own course work which will culminate with a thesis. The duration of this programme is 2 years. The usual courses may include the following: dynamics of stellar and planetary systems, general plasma physics, high energy Physicalscience and dark matter, plasma waves and propulsion, scientific computing and differential equations. The thesis should be based on original research and can ricochet the studentsâ€™ career towards the path of teaching as well. The average cost of this degree in the US is approximately $13,600 per year for local students and $36,300 for international students.",
