        "During the course of your study, you will be familiarised with fundamental concepts of visual art, design and modelling. You will also analyse how design and art evolved in relation to societal and historical changes to best fit the contextual needs. Furthermore, you can expect a lot of credit hours to be spent in the studio, drilling skills like 3D structuring, prototyping, CAD rendering, 3D printing and design management.",
      content2: "By the end of your study, you will be able to communicate ideas about products as varied as medical instruments, mobile apps, furniture and electronic appliances, often using powerful computer modelling software. Industrial design teaches you not only how to conduct market research and develop your concept but also how to make a working prototype and effectively market it.",

        content2:"Industrial design is distinct from other design fields in that it greatly emphasises problem-solving. This field of study allows you to combine your creative nature with your knack for problem-solving to design products that add significant value to the lives of others.",
        content3:"In some ways, this is far more challenging than being any other artist because here you have to design products that are not only appealing but also functional. So, if youâ€™re wondering if this field is right for you, just ask yourself this question, and you will know the answer: Am I creative and good at problem-solving?",

        "The 6% growth in the employment rate for the field foreshadows the promise industrial design will hold in the coming years. Over the past decade, companies have increasingly become aware of the requirement for an industrial designer and are now more willing than ever before to allocate capital towards innovation and product design. This has occurred due to several factors such as increased global competition, increased focus on customer satisfaction, and so on.",
        content2:"On average, around 3100 new job opportunities are estimated to open each year in the US alone! Not only that, but many new companies globally are revamping their entire product focus to create products for mass use that tie in with maximising customer satisfaction. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS), industrial designers can earn upward of $118,000 after acquiring experience in the field, which is indicative of the growing awareness of the importance of industrial designers.",
