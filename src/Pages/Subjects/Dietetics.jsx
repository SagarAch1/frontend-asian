Students that do not qualify for college criteria, which is sometimes the case for international students, will be required to take up foundation courses in their first year.",
      content2:"Your bachelor's degree can then be followed by either a masterâ€™s in a more specialised field of Dietetics such as public health, clinical nutrition, sports dietetics, paediatric nutrition, gerontological nutrition, corporate nutrition. Itâ€™s important to keep in mind that most professional settings will expect to see some form of an accredited internship or experience in addition to your degree.",
      content3:"A bachelor's degree in Dietetics costs around $16,000 per year in the US and prepares students for advanced careers in the field. It is also required for graduate studies in Dietetics specialties. In the UK, a bachelor's in Dietetics can cost on average anywhere between $20,000 per year.",

The significance of food and nutrition in improving health and wellbeing has come to the fore in recent years. Consequently, its popularity as part of healthcare systems has also skyrocketed.",
      content2:"The rise in the incidence of metabolic diseases, high healthcare spending, and the expansion of the middle class in emerging nations are all driving the worldwide clinical nutrition industry forward. Furthermore, the market is predicted to rise due to the rising number of senior people and the development of therapeutic nutrition products tailored to the needs of the aged.
