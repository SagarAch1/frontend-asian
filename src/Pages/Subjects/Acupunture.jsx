        "Acupuncturists are healthcare professionals skilled in acupuncture who address various health issues by stimulating specific body points. This is done using needles or techniques such as pressure, heat, or electric currents. The goal is to balance the flow of energy, or â€˜qi,â€™ in the body. They may also provide lifestyle and dietary advice.",
