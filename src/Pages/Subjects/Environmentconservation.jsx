        content2:"In todayâ€™s world, as human population continues to grow rapidly, the demand for energy sources is also increasing. The alarming rates at which our natural resources continue depleting necessitates an urgent need to broaden the effort for sustainable practices which is why studying Conservation as a subject has gained immense popularity recently.",

      title: "Is Environmental Conservation right for me?",
      content:
        "Conservation scientists are involved in extensive research and data mining, hence must possess good analytical skills, critical thinking and sound reasoning. Since they mostly work collaboratively with teams of field staff and analysts, a high level of team work and good interpersonal skills are a must. If this sounds like you, then a career in Conservation might be a good choice for you.",

        "A bachelorâ€™s degree is typically the minimumâ€¯educationâ€¯required for entry levelâ€¯jobsâ€¯in environmental conservation. It takes 4 years to complete and costs around $14,000-$38,000 per year. Further specialise can be pursued with a master's degree which takes about 1-2 years to complete and costs around $32,000 in the US.",

        "The importance of Conservation studies has never been higher. With the effects climate change more evident than ever before, there is an increasing demand for qualified conservation professionals. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, overall employment of conservation scientists and foresters is projected to grow 7 percent from 2020 to 2030, about as fast as the average for all occupations. About 40,000 new openings for conservation scientists and foresters are projected over the decade. ",
