        "As the name suggests, tax accounting focuses solely on a clientâ€™s taxes rather than their overall financial position. As a tax professional, youâ€™ll have to follow the relevant laws when filing taxes on your clientsâ€™ behalf and also seek to maximise the tax write-offs they can claim. Tax accountants also provide tax planning advice to their clients and work to stay on top of changing tax laws.",

      title: "Is Tax Accounting right for me?",

        "Tax accounting is ideal for detail-oriented people who enjoy solving problems. Strong numeracy skills, time management skills and a willingness to adopt new technologies will also help you go far.",
      content2: "For most of the year, youâ€™ll likely have a routine work schedule between the hours of 9am and 5pm. At tax time, however, youâ€™ll work long hours and even weekends to keep on top of your duties.",

Most professional tax accountants possess a Bachelor of Accounting or a Bachelor of Accounting and Finance. Itâ€™s also possible to become a tax professional with a two-year Diploma.",
      content2: "Bear in mind that each country will have its own rules and regulations that tax professionals must abide by. This might include completing a board-approved course, getting registered with the relevant tax board, or completing relevant work experience.",
      content3: "Itâ€™s also worth doing a cost-benefit analysis to determine what level of education youâ€™d like to pursue. Accountants who have completed a Bachelorâ€™s degree earn a median salary of USD$69,000 while those with a Masterâ€™s degree earn around USD$91,000, so it may be worth pursuing a higher level of education! To give you a general idea, most international students will spend upwards of $30,000 on their accounting degree.",
      content4: "Youâ€™ll also have to factor in the cost of any certifications or registrations you need to legally practice in the country you intend to work in. For example, Australians have to register with the Tax Practitioners Board, while UK accountants must register with Her Majestyâ€™s Revenue and Customs (HMRC).",

      content2:"In the accounting field more generally, jobs are expected to grow by 10-11% in the next five years, equating to 139,900 jobs. Given how complicated tax laws are, tax accountants are sure to remain in high demand.",
