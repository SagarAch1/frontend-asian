        "Landscape Design and Architecture is a sub-domain of architecture concerned with the design of outdoor spaces. Landscape architects plan and collaborate with the construction to design outdoor areas such as parks, resorts, monuments and other related spaces that are to be inhabited by people.",
      content2:"Today, environmental concerns and a general push for governments to promote outdoor planning and better designs of public areas has created a growing demand for landscape architects. Not only that, but private organizations also look for landscape architects to create workspaces that includes outdoor spaces, as well.",

      title: "Is Landscape Design and Architecture right for me?",
      content1:
        "Landscape design is a collaborative field. A professional in this field usually works alongside construction managers, other architects, engineers and planners to make sure the intended design is translated into the physical structure accurately. Not only that, but a landscape architect must have a creative problem-solving approach to tackle unanticipated challenges as they typically arise when working in outdoor spaces. To solve such problems, the landscape architect must also have an analytical approach, along with possessing the ability to visualise how a certain outdoor landscape will turn out.",

      content2:"In the US, international students typically pay an average of $30-40,000 annually to enrol in a landscape design and architecture program. The fee structure for graduate programs is similar, costing around $27,000-$35,000 annually. In Australia, the fee for a 4-year program in Landscape Design costs an average of $20-25,000. For graduate programs, students will be paying anywhere between $20-30,000 annually.",

      content1:
        "Over the past decade or more, there has been a global effort by governments worldwide towards environmental sustainability. This effort includes a need for private and public sector organisations to developmore sustainable designs for outdoor spaces. Not only that, but more and more counties realise that the economic importance of tourism is closely tied to creating sustainable and aesthetic outdoor environments. In this regard, the need for and importance of landscape designers for projects such as public parks, monuments and other related spaces have increased dramatically.",
