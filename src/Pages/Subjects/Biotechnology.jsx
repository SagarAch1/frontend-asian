        "The study of biotechnology has been there in formal or informal ways throughout the centuries. In ancient times, humans used to manufacture cheese and yogurt by culturing milk with microbes. Whereas now, we have advances that allow us to study microbes at their genetic level. Thanks to biotechnology, now we have been able to mass-produce insulin as well. From creating lifesaving artificial hormones, a biotechnologist is at the forefront of innovation. The application of the field is immense and wide. Anyone pursuing a career in the field would find themselves constantly being challenged to find new solutions to problems.",
