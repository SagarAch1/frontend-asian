While creativity is somewhat subjective, and it might be hard for any person to judge their own work, the field does require someone who is passionate about the subject, and can approach whatever they are working on in a creative manner.

While this field is growing, any aspiring candidates should keep in mind that they will be competing in a highly-competitive industry where skill will be required in order to grow.
