        "Physical science is the study of non-living materials that are found in the natural environment and their qualities. The study of matter and energy is referred to as physical science. It comprises chemistry, which is concerned with matter, and physics, which is concerned with energy. Its advancements allow us to achieve extraordinary feats like flight and space travel. ",

        "Physical sciences students must have a solid background in math and science, particularly chemistry and physics. Analytical and critical thinking, communication, problem-solving, and teamwork abilities are also required for a successful career in this sector. This is because scientists frequently collaborate to solve problems, it's critical that accurate information be disseminated quickly, and project needs be fully stated. If as a child you were always inclined towards the sciences, then this degree is a good choice for you.",
