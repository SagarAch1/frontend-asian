        "Environmental Engineering is interdisciplinary degree, which intergrates environmental science, mechanical engineering, chemistry, civil engineering and ecology. Students learn how to design, develop and produce tools, devices and systems that mitigate pollution and help preserve the environment.",
      content2:
        "As an Environmental Engineering student, you will research water, soil, and air pollution issues and develop technical solutions compatible with legislative, economic, social, and political concerns to solve, mitigate, or control these issues.",
      content3:"Environmental Engineering is geared towards making societal growth and the utilisation of water, land, and air resources as sustainable as possible. This objective is attained by managing these resources in such a way that pollution and deterioration of the environment are minimised.",

        "An intrinisic motivation to help preserve the environment is a strong indicator of your interest in this subject. Classroom lectures, laboratory science work, and fieldwork will all be part of your education. Moreover, students who have analytical minds and have a gift for problem-solving tend to perform best. If you believe you possess the aforementioned qualities, then you're an ideal fit for Environmental Engineering.",
