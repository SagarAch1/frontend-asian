        "Human Welfare studies and services comprise the study of social justice, human rights, social empowerment, child welfare along with psychology and general education courses. The eclectic mix of subjects makes for a well-rounded education that emphasises critical thinking abilities, which are indispensable when working in intercultural environments at the international level. The main goal of this specialised field of study is to learn more about the societal, governmental, and financial contexts in which social policy is established, directed, and applied. Furthermore, it includes learning how to plan and manage welfare programs, as well as coordinating resources to meet the needs of individuals and communities.",

      content2:"In fact, by 2025, there is an expected shortage of one million social care professionals in the US! Ageing populations, decreasing global fitness levels and virus outbreaks like the COVID-19 pandemic have reinforced the need for human welfare and services as one of the most secure career paths with plenty of scaling opportunities in the coming years.",
