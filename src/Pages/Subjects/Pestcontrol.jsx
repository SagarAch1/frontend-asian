        "One of the biggest reasons of crop failure is pest and weed attacking the crops. It is necessary for farmers to apply techniques that keep these insects, pest and weed away from their crops. For this purpose, the study of Pest and Weed Control holds great importance. Pest and Weed Control studies enable professional to prepare integrated pest management approaches that combine strategies for pest control that are both cost-effective and environmentally friendly.",

      title: "Is Pest and Weed Control right for me?",
      content:
        "If you want a career in Pest and Weed Control, you must be comfortable working outdoors. Entomologists must not be afraid of insects and must be ready to handle them and their waste. Pest and weed specialists need high observation skills because their work often needs them to observe and record facts about insect behaviour, appearance, and habitat. Aside from that, depending on the work, Pest and Weed Control specialists must have good communication skills to convey their findings in writing to academics, students, policymakers, and other stakeholders. They must be able to draw conclusions from data gathered through research, observation, and experiments, which necessitates strong critical thinking abilities. If this sounds like you, then Pest and Weed Control might be a good choice for you.",

The masterâ€™s program is 1-3 years long depending on your area of specialisation. The average tuition & fees of the Plant Protection and Integrated Pest Management programme are betweenâ€¯$10,067 to $25,468 in the US.",

        "The need for more crop production and better plant life has increased now more than ever before. A large part of reason is the booming population. With increased demand, the risk and complications of plant diseases has also increased. Thus, we need Pest and Weed Control specialists to help us keep productions high and prevent crop failures. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, from 2020 to 2030, new jobs for agricultural and food scientists are expected to grow at a rate of 9%. Moreover, agricultural and food scientists are expected to have about 4,400 job opportunities each year this decade.",
