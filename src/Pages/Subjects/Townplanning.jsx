      content1:
        "Town planning is an interdisciplinary field that draws upon fields like planning, architecture, surveying, landscape architecture and construction engineering to help address the global challenge of land resource management in an integrated fashion. Town planning also includes strategy planning, which is imperative in order to manage the future requirement of land.",
      content2:
        "It is important to note that the needs and requirements of managing land will depend greatly on the policies, development proposals, as well as the needs of the locals. Such dynamics are essential in order to ensure a balance between the demands of the land that is being developed, as well as meeting the needs of the locals.",

      title: "Is Town Planning right for me?",
      content:
        "Town planners are skilled at analysing information, resources, conducting market research and management skills. Because town planners will have to manage resources, specifically land resources, they are highly skilled at planning assignments and decision-making. They combine creativity and realism to execute a plan or action. Town planners are also skilled communicators as they interact with different officials, interest groups, and locals presenting them with proposals. If you possess the above-mentioned qualities, then you are a great fit for this profession.",

If we look at the cost of a bachelorâ€™s degree in town planning, it can cost you anywhere between $20,000 to $40,000 per year in the US. However, if you go for a Bachelorâ€™s degree in the UK or Australia, it can cost you between $17,000 to $25,000 per year and $15,000 to $33,000 per year, respectively.",
      content2:
        "The next step in your education would be a masterâ€™s degree in town planning. Of course, which masterâ€™s program you will go for will vary according to the electives, coursework, as well as geographical and environmental location of the school. You can further specialise in a subfield, such as environmental planning or city design. A masterâ€™s degree in town planning in the US will cost you anywhere between $10,000 to $30,000. As for the UK and Australia, a masterâ€™s degree in the same field will cost you Â£9,000 to Â£30,000 and AUD15,400 to AUD26,600, respectively.",
