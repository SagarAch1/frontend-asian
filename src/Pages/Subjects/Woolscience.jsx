        "Wool Science studies are designed to offer individuals skills and expertise in the production, harvesting, preparation, marketing, manufacturing, and processing of wool to the wool industry.",
      content2:
      "The different qualifications assist students in understanding wool categorization, production, and processing abilities and technical knowledge that meet the wool supply chainâ€™s requirements, market, and customer requirements. Students also learn ways to maximize return in the wool supply chain.",
      content3:
      "Wool science graduates can expect to work in consulting, regulatory, and research positions in the commercial and public sectors across the agricultural spectrum. A wide range of occupations are accessible, from large-scale rangeland farming to high-input grazing and feed lotting.",

      title: "Is Wool science right for me?",
      content1:
        "The wool Science studies take an in-depth look at the wool fibre, structure, chemistry and physics. They also explore the implications of the wool fibreâ€™s structure, physics, and chemistry in terms of the properties and benefits of wool products. Students will be taught basic wool science principles, market structure, and domestic and international factors that influence the wool industry in order to expand the studentâ€™s knowledge and understanding of proper wool preparation.",
      content2:
      "It is easier to understand the processing of wool and the performance of the subsequent products if you understand the behaviour of the wool fibre from the outset. The purpose of the Wool Science degree is to provide the wool industry with individuals who have the relevant skills and knowledge regarding the production, harvesting, preparation, marketing, manufacturing and processing of wool.",
