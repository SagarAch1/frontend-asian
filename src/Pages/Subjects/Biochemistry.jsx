        "The subject of study in biochemistry is living beings and the various chemical processes that underpin their existence. From studying viruses to engineering their cures, the field of biochemistry is vast. It is a field that requires critical thinking and a deep understanding of how key concepts relate to one another. Much of biochemistry deals with the structures, bonding, functions, and interactions of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids.â€¯",

      content2:"Biochemistry has three major branches 1.Structural Biology overlaps with molecular biology and biophysics as it moves to understand the structure of biological macromolecules and their functions. Structural biologists have made significant contributions towards understanding the molecular components associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type II diabetes. 2. Enzymology is the study of enzymes. Developing an understanding of how these biological catalysts affect chemical reactions allows us to understand the relationship of different chemical groups. Enzymes are used in the chemical industry and other industrial applications when extremely specific catalysts are required. 3.Metabolic biochemistry is the field in which the life-sustaining chemical reactions taking place inside an organism are studied: the conversion of the energy in food to energy available to run cellular processes.",

It has been the go-to choice for a large number of international students. There are universities such as Caltech, Harvard, and MIT that offer the best blend of courses to be well versed in the theoretical and applied aspects of the field. The average cost of studying biochemistry in the US is around is $35,000 per annum for a 3 or 4-year program.Another popular destination for studying biochemistry is the United Kingdom. The average annual cost of studying biochemistry in the UK for an international student is Â£39,010 per annum. UKâ€™s world renowned Oxford University houses the largest biochemistry department in Europe. The universityâ€™s 4-year undergrad program is renowned for cultivating some of the most outstanding biochemists in the world.Japan is also a popular destination for a degree in biochemistry, because of its experimental focus and state-of-the-art laboratories. The country is considered a powerhouse in biochemistry research. Students can apply to top universities like the University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, and Tohoku University. The average cost of a biochemistry degree in Japan is $12,000 per annum.â€¯",
