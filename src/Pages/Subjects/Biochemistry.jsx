        "Biochemistry examines the chemical processes that drive living organisms. It is a broad field encompassing the study of viruses, the development of cures, and the investigation of how macromolecules like proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids interact and function within cells.",
      content2:
        "Biochemistry is divided into three main branches: 1. Structural Biology, which explores the molecular structure of macromolecules and their relevance to diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s, Parkinsonâ€™s, and diabetes. 2. Enzymology, focused on understanding the role of enzymes as biological catalysts. 3. Metabolic Biochemistry, studying energy conversions that occur within organisms to sustain life.",
