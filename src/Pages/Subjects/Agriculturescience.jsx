      title: "Is Agriculture Science right for me?",
      content:
        "Agriculture Science imbues the skills of adaptability, problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration, organisation and analytical thinking in the students. It also provides necessary technical and business skills along with the knowledge of environmental and life sciences to prepare the students for their professional life. If you want to lead a life close to nature and desire to promote a green economy, then studying agriculture as a subject may appeal to you.",

      title: "Agriculture Science study options and cost",
      content1:
        "Students may pursue a bachelorâ€™s degree in Agriculture Science after high school. The courses are generally focused on biological and agricultural sciences, management of livestock and agricultural business. The general coursework may include livestock biometrics, agricultural research and statistics, microeconomics in agriculture, business management and agricultural marketing. The degree spans four years and costs up to $180,000.",
        content2:"After a bachelorâ€™s, students may pursue a masterâ€™s degree in the discipline of choice. This degree also enables the students to undertake independent research work and teaching as a profession. The general coursework may include disciplines like agriculture technology, food chain theory, research methods in agriculture, plant pathology, pest management, water science, preventive veterinary medicine, biostatistics and agricultural leadership. Upon completion of this degree, students may endeavour to enhance crop management and agricultural development in rural areas of a country. Students must submit a research paper towards the end of their degree. The programme spans two years and may cost up to $72,000, depending on the university you choose.",
        content3:"Students desirous of specialising and carrying out research in a specific sub-field of Agriculture Science may undertake a PhD programme. Specialisations usually include agriculture and environmental risks, agricultural statistics, integrated animal management, agribusiness management and soil/plant relationships. This degree is purely based on research and ends with a dissertation. The degree spans three to four years and may cost up to $98,000."

      content:
        "According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the overall employment of agriculture/food scientists and agricultural engineers is projected to grow by 9% and 5%, respectively. Challenges such as population growth, increased demand for water resources, combating pests and pathogens, changes in climate and weather patterns, and additional demand for agriculture products, such as biofuels, will continue to create demand for research in agricultural efficiency and sustainability. Growing populations and stronger global competition will result in the industry needing more efficient means of production, which will increase the demand for agricultural engineers as well. Thus professionals having a degree in Agriculture Science may well be in demand.",
