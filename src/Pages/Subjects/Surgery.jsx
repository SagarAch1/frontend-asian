        "Surgery deals with medical procedures which are performed to structurally alter the human body by incision. It is the diagnostic or therapeutic treatment of medical conditions by any instruments, causing localised alteration or transportation of live human tissues, which include lasers, ultrasound, ionising radiation, scalpels, probes, and needles. Injection of diagnostic or therapeutic substances into body cavities, internal organs, joints, sensory organs, and the central nervous system is also considered to be surgery.",
        content2:"There are four major categories of surgery:â€¯(1) wound treatment, (2) extirpative surgery, (3) reconstructive surgery, and (4) transplantation surgery. Almost all types of surgeries require administering anaesthesia to eliminate any pain that the patient might feel during the surgical procedure.",
        content3:"As surgery is at the forefront of healthcare innovation, it isâ€¯a challenging, intellectually stimulating and rewarding career. Performing an operation and seeing a patient's life improve almost immediately is incredibly satisfying and a great privilege for many surgeons. A surgeonâ€™s role is not confined to the operating theatre though. Surgeons work in a number of professional settings including clinics, hospitals, healthcare facilities, research and educational institutions.",

They must be able to maintain situational awareness and lead their team in the theatre, which requires leadership skills and teamwork. They ought to have empathy and good communication skills.",
        content2:"Students who excel in the field of Surgery are driven by intellectual curiosity which allows them to acquire knowledge and remain abreast with latest trends in the field. In addition, surgeons must be empathetic as they must counsel and advise the families on treatment possibilities. If you believe that you possess the aforementioned qualities, then Surgery might be well suited for you.",

      title: "Study options and costs",

        "Becoming a surgeon requires extensive education. The first step is to earn a bachelorâ€™s degree with the required prerequisite courses to apply to a medical college for postgraduation study. These courses are usually science subjects such as Chemistry and Biology. The undergraduate studies span 4 years and cost around $9,410 to $23,890 per year in the US. The curriculum includes clinical rotations in addition to traditional coursework and time spent in laboratories.",
        content2:"After completing medical school and any pre-requisite certifications, students of Surgery undergo 3 to 7 years of training in residency.â€¯If a surgeon desire to specialise further, they apply for fellowships, which are challenging and hold excellent prospects. The annual salary during residency ranges from $55,000 to $60,000.",
