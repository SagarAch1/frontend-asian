      "Plant Science studies how plants are used to make food, change the environment, restore damaged landscapes, promote human health and well-being, improve communal surroundings, and provide leisure and practical benefits to the general public. This research is critical to the preservation of the environment. ",

      content:
        "Plant scientists are driven by their curiosity and desire to protect the environment, and they are often involved in activities that help them explore more about plants and preservation. They are critical thinkers and good at problem-solving. Moreover, they have efficient data analysis skills to collect and interpret data using a variety of methods and are able to communicate their findings effectively for others to benefit from it. If you believe you have the aforementioned qualities, then Plant Sciences might be a good choice for you.",

Undergraduate coursework for plant scientists typically includes biology, chemistry, botany, and plant conservation. A bachelorâ€™s programme usually takes 4 years to complete and costs around $8,218-$20,790 in US. A masterâ€™s programme takes around 1-3 years to complete depending on the specialisation you opted for. The average tuition for a graduate programme in US is $23,902 per year.",
