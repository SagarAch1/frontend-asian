        "General History majors learn how to critically study the past, allowing them to view the current geo-politcial and socio-cultural events through a historical perspective. Students who seek a General History degree may expect to study about ancient civilisations of the world. Majors at various schools are required to take a seminar where they polish their skills at analysing history. They learn how to interact with original materials, study historical literature, and debate opposing viewpoints in such classes.",
      content2:
        "Many history programmes have chronological and geographic course requirements, requiring students to learn about the premodern era and travel to different parts of the world.",

      title: "Is General History right for me?",
      content:
        "A General History degree can be a good fit for you if you constantly ask questions about issues like politics, war, or culture and aren't content with simple answers. Because history is such a large subject, students will be asked to speciailise in the history of a particular region or culture. Students should also expect to spend a significant amount of time reading and writing, as well as being able to comprehend different, often opposing points of view. ",

      content1:
        "Study options highly depend on the career path you aim to take in the future. For example, you must have a bachelor's degree in General History to work as a historian. After that, most historians pursue a master's or doctorate degree, during which time they conduct research and submit a thesis in their chosen field. Generally, you'll take introductory History courses in the first year of your college degree. You'll also have electives to pursue a second major of your choice in some cases. History courses will make up 40% of your classes in your senior year. History majors may also be required to take a capstone course that requires them to write a large research report.",
      content2:
        "If you plan on becoming a historian, you must first complete high school and then pursue a history degree at college. After earning a bachelor's degree, aspiring historians must enrol in a graduate school in their chosen field of study. Some historical professions require candidates to hold a PhD in their field of study. In such a competitive sector, a history applicant must have research experience in the field of his specialisation.",
      content3:
        "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), historians with a bachelor's degree in general history mostly pursue instructional and research careers. Becoming a museum technician is another popular career. If they do not go into public school teaching, those with bachelor's degrees in history seek jobs in media, law, or business. A master's or doctorate in history is required for most historians to work in the discipline.",

        "The BLS predicts that the occupation of historians will grow at a pace of 6%, which is about average for all occupations. Since technological advancements have offered more opportunities for big changes in how museums will show their collections to the public, there is a greater need in the museum sector. For qualified historians, there will be more development in the archive profession than in other positions.",

The historian must first collect data from many sources, formulate hypotheses based on the facts, then proceed to draw conclusions about all of these facets of life at that time and location.",
