      content:
        "A General History degree is ideal for those who are always asking deeper questions about topics like politics, war, or culture and are unsatisfied with simple explanations.

Your first year of study typically includes introductory courses in history, and you may also take electives or pursue a second major. By your senior year, history courses will comprise approximately 40% of your classes, and you may need to complete a capstone project that involves substantial research writing.",
      content2:
        "To become a historian, you first need to complete high school and then pursue a history degree in college. After earning a bachelor's degree, you must attend graduate school in your specific field. Some historical career paths, such as academic or advanced research roles, require a PhD. In a competitive field like history, experience in research is often essential.",
      content3:
        "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), most historians with a bachelor's degree work in teaching and research roles, while some also pursue positions as museum technicians. If not pursuing a career in education, history graduates may find opportunities in fields like media, law, or business. However, most serious historians require a graduate degree (master's or PhD) to advance in the field.",
