          <h3>Understanding Test Anxiety</h3>
          <p>
            Exam stress is a set of physiological responses and psychological processes that adversely affect students’ performance during tests. Common symptoms include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Physical Symptoms: Headache, nausea, sweating, tachycardia, and muscle contraction but the actual intensity and type of reaction depends upon the specific drug.</li>
            <li>Emotional Symptoms: It prompts feelings of fear, helplessness, and self-doubt.</li>
            <li>Behavioral Symptoms: Lack of focus, delayed action and avoidance.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These are some of the symptoms of test anxiety, and knowing them helps in handling the situation.
          </p>

          <h3>Start Early</h3>
          <p>
            Early Preparation: You should commence your preparation much earlier in order to make the necessary preparations. This will ensure that you have enough time to go through all your courses and ensure that you do not cram at the last minute.
          </p>
          <p>
            Create a Study Schedule: Assemble the timetable according to the course’s schedule and try to follow that timetable. Do not mass yourself with a large amount of material at once; this will only make things worse.
          </p>

          <h3>Practice Regularly</h3>
          <p>
            Mock Tests: Always solve full-length tests under time pressure as the conditions in the actual exams will be similar. This will assist you in familiarizing yourself with the test format and time to save you more time in the long run.
          </p>
          <p>
            Familiarize Yourself with the Test: Understanding the overall structure and the specifics of the questions that you are going to be confronted with during the IELTS and/or TOEFL exams can minimize anxiety.
          </p>

          <h3>Develop Effective Study Habits</h3>
          <p>
            Active Learning: They include summarizing the information, teaching others what has been learnt, and using flashcards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use Official Study Materials: Take advantage of the IELTS and TOEFL materials such as tests, questions, and study materials on English as a second language.
          </p>

          <h3>Manage Your Time</h3>
          <p>
            Time Management: The amount of time spent on each part of the test is usually limited when taking an actual test; therefore, one should emulate the real-life situation during practice. It will also assist you in the right organization of time whenever you are undertaking the actual test.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prioritize Difficult Areas: On the section which you took more time in, make sure you feel less confident so that you can spend more time and gain more skills and knowledge on the section.
          </p>

          <h3>Stay Healthy</h3>
          <p>
            Proper Nutrition: Take balanced diets for meals to be able to have strength throughout the day. Coffee should be limited together with foods containing sugar since they cause anxiety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regular Exercise: Physical activity should be included in the daily schedule to help avoid stress and increase accuracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adequate Sleep: This means that you should develop a sleeping schedule where you’ll sleep for adequate hours in a day with special regard to the last night before taking the exam. Anxiety is a weapon of productivity that can be worsened by shortage of sleep and deteriorated cognitive skills.
          </p>

          <h3>Practice Relaxation Techniques</h3>
          <p>
            Deep Breathing: Take a few breaths because the act of breathing helps the nervous system get pacified. Breathe in through your nose and out with your mouth gradually, taken from five seconds to thirty seconds for each breath.
          </p>
          <p>
            Progressive Muscle Relaxation: Consequently, various muscle areas should be contracted and then relaxed to assist in the elimination of stiffness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visualization: Self-imagine yourself passing the exam; self-realization of success in the exams is an essential step towards its achievement. Visualization about the positive outcomes could help to strengthen confidence.
          </p>

          <h3>Stay Positive</h3>
          <p>
            Positive Affirmations: One should work at changing negative thoughts into positive affirmations. Think about the things that you did well in the past – the achievements which you had or successful moments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Set Realistic Goals: Ensure that you set appropriate goals for each study session and be happy for what you have achieved. This will make you have the motivation and concentration you need in doing your task.
          </p>

          <h3>Seek Support</h3>
          <p>
            Talk to Others: Talk to your friends, relatives, teachers or anyone who will listen and be willing to help. There will be times when you aimlessly disclose the stress in your life to feel relieved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Join Study Groups: Team up with other students who are writing for the same exams as IELTS or TOEFL. From completion of the activity, it is clear that study groups can help in providing support and/or improvement of learning.
