            The Scholastic Assessment Test or the SAT is a standardized test that
            is widely adopted by college admissions in the United States of
            America. Its core purpose is to measure a high school student’s
            readiness for college and give a uniform rating/grade system through
            which universities can compare all students. A good SAT score can
            make or break your application, although it cannot ensure your
            chances it can surely give your application a massive boost, but
            what exactly constitutes a “good” SAT score? A good SAT score can
            vary depending on your goals and the universities you are targeting.
          </p>

          <h3>Understanding The SAT Scores</h3>
          <p>
            The SAT is divided into two sections:
            <ul>
              <li>Evidence-Based Reading and Writing</li>
              <li>Math</li>
            </ul>
            Each of these sections is scored on a total scale of 800, making the
            total a complete score of 1600.
          </p>

          <h3>Average SAT Scores</h3>
          <p>
            The average SAT scores for Nepali students is typically around
            1050-1100 where students usually score 530 in the Reading and
            Writing section and 520 in the Math section. Scoring around this
            range puts you in the middle section of all test takers which can be
            sufficient for most universities and colleges. But, more competitive
            and Ivy League schools require higher scores.
          </p>

          <h3>What Is A Good SAT Score?</h3>
          <p>
            A “good” SAT score can be subjective and is heavily dependent on
            your college ambitions. The general breakdown is as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Above Average Scores (1200-1400):</strong> Scoring in this
              range puts you above the average test takers, it opens doors for
              you to apply to a wide range of colleges and may qualify for
              merit-based scholarships. For example, if you get a 1300 in the
              SAT it puts you in the top 14% of the test takers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Competitive Scores (1400-1500):</strong> This range makes
              you a very competitive candidate for many high-end colleges and
              universities. Schools such as New York University, Boston College,
              etc., often take students with scores in this range.
            </li>

            alt="Blog image"
            className="blog-main-image"
          />
            <li>
              <strong>Top Tier Scores (1500-1600):</strong> Scoring above 1500
              in the SAT puts you in the top 1-2% of the test takers. These
              scores are typically ideal for applying to Ivy League schools and
              other top-end institutions like Stanford, MIT, and Caltech. For
              example, the average SAT score for students who are admitted to
              Ivy League colleges is around 1520.

          </ul>

          <h3>SAT Scores and College Admissions</h3>
          <p>
            While having a higher score on the SAT can help your application
            stand out, it is also very important to remember that it is just one
            part of your college application. Universities also take into
            account how high your GPA is in high school, extracurricular
            activities, letters of recommendation, personal essays, and
            volunteer work.
          </p>

          <h3>Setting Your SAT Score Goal</h3>
          <p>
            To determine your SAT score goal, you should start by researching
            the average scores for admitted students at the universities you’re
            interested in. This kind of information is usually found in the
            websites of the individual universities. You should set your sights
            on getting a score at or above these scores to strengthen your
            application.
          </p>
          <p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to how you should set your SAT goal:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make a List Of Colleges: Identify the colleges you want to go to.</li>
            <li>
              Research Admission Statistics: Find the average percentile of SAT
              scores for these schools.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set Your Goal: Aim for a score above the 75th percentile to be a
              competitive applicant.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Improving Your SAT Score</h3>
          <p>
            If you have already taken the SAT and you are not satisfied with
            your score you can retake it but be prepared. Some of the ways to
            improve your score are:

          <ul>
            <li>Take Practice Tests</li>
            <li>Review Your Mistakes</li>

            <li>Consider Preparation Courses</li>
            <li>Stay Consistent</li>
          </ul>
